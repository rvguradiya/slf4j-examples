# Feature Overview: SLF4J Examples

This document provides an overview of the key features of the **Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)** and how they are demonstrated in this repository. Each feature is paired with example implementations to help you understand their usage and benefits.

---

## 1. Basic Logging
SLF4J supports all major logging levels to provide a consistent logging interface. These levels include:

- **TRACE**: Fine-grained debug messages.
- **DEBUG**: General debugging information.
- **INFO**: Informational messages.
- **WARN**: Warnings about potential issues.
- **ERROR**: Serious errors.

### Examples:
- **HelloWorldLogger**: Demonstrates simple logging using SLF4J.
- **LoggingLevelsExample**: Covers the usage of all available logging levels.

---

## 2. Parameterized Logging
SLF4J allows you to use placeholders (`{}`) for dynamic values in log messages. This avoids unnecessary string concatenation and improves performance.

### Example:
- **ParameterizedLogging**: Demonstrates how to use placeholders in log messages.

---

## 3. Integration with Logging Frameworks
SLF4J can integrate seamlessly with several logging frameworks, enabling developers to switch between them without modifying their logging code.

Supported frameworks include:
- **Logback** (recommended default)
- **Log4j2**
- **Java Util Logging (JUL)**

### Examples:
- **LogbackExample**: Demonstrates SLF4J integration with Logback.
- **Log4j2Example**: Demonstrates SLF4J integration with Log4j2.
- **JULExample**: Demonstrates SLF4J integration with Java Util Logging.

## 4. Advanced Features
SLF4J offers several advanced features that improve contextual logging and filtering capabilities:

### 4.1 Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)
MDC allows you to attach contextual information (e.g., user ID, session ID) to your log messages. This is particularly useful in multi-threaded applications.

#### Example:
- **MDCExample**: Demonstrates how to use MDC for logging additional context.

### 4.2 Markers
Markers are used to add metadata to log messages. They help categorize or filter logs based on specific tags.

#### Example:
- **MarkerExample**: Demonstrates how to use markers for filtering log messages.

### 4.3 Exception Logging
SLF4J simplifies exception logging by allowing you to log the exception stack trace directly alongside custom messages.

#### Example:
- **ExceptionHandlingExample**: Demonstrates best practices for logging exceptions.

## 5. Configuration
SLF4J relies on the underlying logging framework for configuration. This repository includes configuration files for commonly used frameworks:

- **Logback**: `LogbackConfig.xml`
- **Log4j2**: `Log4j2Config.xml`

---

## Summary
SLF4J provides a clean and unified API for logging in Java applications. By exploring the examples in this repository, you can:

- Understand how to use SLF4J's basic and advanced features.
- Learn how to integrate SLF4J with various logging frameworks.
- Master best practices for efficient and effective logging.
